- Class A has a wider range of scores compared to Class B.
> cat("- Class A's distribution appears to be skewed towards higher scores, while Class B's distribution is more symmetric.\n")
- Class A's distribution appears to be skewed towards higher scores, while Class B's distribution is more symmetric.
> cat("- Class A has a higher median and a more spread-out interquartile range compared to Class B.\n")
- Class A has a higher median and a more spread-out interquartile range compared to Class B.
